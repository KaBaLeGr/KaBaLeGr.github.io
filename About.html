       <h1>About us</h1>
       <br>
       <p>Valetio is a mobile car cleaning service that was founded in 2023 by Karl Green, a car enthusiast and entrepreneur, along with a group of friends equally enthusiastic about cars. Karl wanted to create a service that would make car owners' lives easier and more enjoyable, by providing them with a convenient and affordable way to keep their cars clean and shiny.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Valetio operates in Sutton Coldfield, a town in Birmingham, UK. We have a team of professional and friendly staff who are trained and equipped to deliver high-quality car washes and valets to our customers.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Valetio offers monthly subscription plans that allow our customers to request unlimited car washes and valets at any time and place. Whether they need a quick rinse or a full interior and exterior detail, we can do it all. Our customers can book online using our easy and secure booking system, and we'll come to their location with our mobile car wash equipment and supplies.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Valetio's vision is to become the leading mobile car cleaning service in the UK. We are planning to expand our service area to other constituencies in Birmingham and eventually to other cities and regions in the UK. We are also constantly looking for ways to improve our service quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Valetio's mission is to make car owners happy by providing them with a hassle-free and cost-effective way to maintain their cars. We believe that a clean car is not only a reflection of the owner's personality, but also a source of pride and joy. We want to help our customers enjoy their cars more by taking care of the cleaning for them.</p>
